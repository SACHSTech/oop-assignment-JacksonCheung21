## Summary
The system that is being modelled is a streaming plaform known as twitch. In the main program it asks for the user to create an account through putting a name and their age. With this we know the users name and age so later on in the program if the user wants to buy bits in twitch it will determine based on his age if hes allowed to buy or not. However it does not limit anything other then that as the system will print out random streamers where they can select to watch. When they watch they have options to follow subsribe, buy bits and leave depending if they want to leave twitch or not they can return back to main page and pick other streamers available to watch.
